# KaryScript tmLanguage definitions.
This is KaryScript's tmLanguage grammar for code highlighting.

## Editing.
Complex RegExes must be edited and be commented using [Orchestra Language](https://github.com/karyfoundation/orchestra).

Also tmLanguage files must be generated by converting the main `json` source code to a `plist` file
